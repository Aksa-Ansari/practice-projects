# Dentytech Landing Page (HTML & CSS Practice)

This project is a learning and revision project created to strengthen my  
HTML and CSS fundamentals.  
I built this landing page to revise layouts, positioning, transforms, and  
basic responsive design.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project
- To revise my **HTML structure**  
- To practice **CSS layouting** (flexbox, absolute positioning)  
- To understand **transform: translate()** for perfect centering  
- To practice **rotating images** for creative design  
- To apply simple **responsive design** using media queries  
- To build confidence by creating a clean UI using just HTML & CSS

## 💡 What I Learned / Revised
- How to center elements using `position: absolute` + `transform`
- How to create a modern navbar layout
- How to stack and rotate images in the center
- How to make things responsive for mobile screens
- How to use Remix Icons CDN
- How to organize a basic front-end project

## 📱 Responsive Adjustments
On small screens (max-width: 600px):
- Navbar becomes smaller  
- Text size reduces  
- Images scale down  
- Layout stays the same, only sizes adjust

## 🛠 Tech Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Remix Icons
