## How It Works

1. User enters a city name and clicks the “Get Weather” button (or presses Enter).  
2. The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API.  
3. While fetching, the button is disabled and a spinner is shown.  
4. Once data is received, it’s displayed in a clean card format.  
5. If the city name is invalid, an error message appears.  
6. After displaying results, the input field clears automatically.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download the project files.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
3. Replace the `API_KEY` in `script.js` with your own key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).  
4. Save the file and enjoy using your Weather App! ☀️
